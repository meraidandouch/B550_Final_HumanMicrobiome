# B550_Final_HumanMicrobiome

### The goal of the project is to practice data analysis in Python. I chose to replicate findings in Miller et al., 2017 and report results and limitations. Because I started with unprocessed data, processing data was the main aspect of the project. Statistical analysis was completed using Python 3.9.7 on Visual Studio Code IDE. This project includes code for calculating cumulative sum normalization, OTU richness, phyla grouping and read count proportions, and alpha and beta diversity. I computed a variety of figures such as relative abundance barplots, alpha and OTU richness spread using boxplots, and finally PcoA coordinates using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix.
